Uber Data Analytics - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in ride-sharing behavior. The main goal is to understand factors like demand patterns, peak hours, and location-based ride trends.

Dataset:-

1. The dataset used is Uber ride data (specify source, e.g., Kaggle).
2. Features include pickup date/time, location coordinates, and ride counts.

Technologies Used :-

1. Python
2. Pandas for data manipulation
3. NumPy for numerical computations
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
5. Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Key Features / Analysis :-

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Time-based Analysis: Hourly, Daily, and Weekly ride trends
3. Geographical Analysis: Hotspots of pickups
4. Visualization of patterns using charts and plots
5. Insights into peak demand hours and locations
